# MPC-NTM-Control
In this project we aim to create a Linear Paramter Varying (LPV) Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to predict and control magnetic islands arising in a tokamak given the following assumptions:
## 1) The state-space representation is based on the La Haye and Generalized Rutherford Equations
## 2) The only control input is EC power to the O-point of the islands
## 3) The EC power does not modulate on and off with the O-point and X-point, but is modeled by the average power of the O-point and X-point
